            <p class="news-content">
                In a humorous mix-up, a <%= location %> resident was found last night digging through the bins behind the Co-op on Elm Street. Passersby, mistaking <%= firstName %> <%= lastName %>, <%= age %>, for a burglar, quickly alerted the police. However, it turned out the person was on a mission to save what they believed were perfectly good egg sandwiches from being wasted.
            </p>
            <p class="news-content">
                <%= firstName %>, determined to combat food waste, was discovered by the police surrounded by discarded sandwiches. “Wasting food just doesn’t sit right with me,” the <%= description %> remarked, holding a salvaged egg sandwich.
            </p>
            <p class="news-content">
                The Co-op manager, who initially reacted with concern, soon found humor in the situation. “While we appreciate the concern for food waste, we don’t recommend dumpster diving as a solution,” they commented. Police, recognizing the harmless nature of the intentions, let <%= firstName %>l go without any charges, and even offered a ride home, ensuring the collected sandwiches were taken along.
            </p>
            <p class="news-content">
                <%= firstName %> now plans to enjoy the egg sandwiches, saved from an unappetizing end. This quirky incident has sparked a review of food waste policies by Co-op, and the police have issued a gentle reminder about the impracticalities of bin-diving, no matter how well-intentioned. The resident, meanwhile, is pleased with the successful rescue of the sandwiches, ready for a delightful meal.
